expectation-driven development (EDD)
- start with your "expectation" about how a thing should work, and work backwards from there
- do not concern yourself with implementation details, performance concerns, etc.
- justâ€¦ what would I expect this thing to work if i didn't have context ?
- if we set this as our expectation. ie. how we want it to work / where we want to get to, it will actually answer several implementation questions _for you_.  You'll see that a lot of things fall into place _first_, (architecture, implementation, approach), etc. allowing you to then _fine-tune_ a solution, knowing that the underlying approach is solid and supports good DX

This is really a way of achieving good DX.



Great minds discuss principles.
Average minds discuss technologies.
Small minds discuss tools.
