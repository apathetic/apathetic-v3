# Accessibility

> AA accessibility (WCAG) guidelines, typography / contrast information, and interaction hit-sizes.


When we think of accessibility, we generally think of how to provide content via alternate channels in support of visually impaired users. However, the visual is but one of several categories of user impairment; the others are often overlooked.

According to the WCAG, there are actually four categories of user impairment:

- [visual](#visual)
- [auditory](#auditory)
- [motor](#motor)
- [cognitive](#cognitive)

Accessibility is a way to ensure that your content is, quite literally, accessible. That it is easily consumed and understood by a wide range of users with different abilities, experiences, knowledge, and context. Each of these categories requires its own set of considerations during a design process, or during xxxx technical implementation.

Lastly, provisions for accessiblity (or a11y, for short) are not hard. They are just overlooked or bypassed ssssas assumptions


## Visual

Most often, visual impairment is what developers, desingers, and the rest of us, think of when the term accessibility is mentioned.

How to support visually impaired users? Make your content easy to read, clear in its presentation, and xxx.
- Designs should meet minimum contrast requirements
- typography should be a sufficient size

Also, for users that need additional support, provide "hints" in the form of ariaxxxattributes, landmarks and roles, `alt` text for images, and visually hidden alternatives for screen readers
- alt text and visually hidden elements are provided as alternatives where relevant
- aria landmarks are provided
- aria roles on interactive UI elements

## Auditory

Perhaps the most overlooped category, user with auditory impairments are
- subititles on vioes
- indication that audio / or someting / is playing


## Motor

Users with impaired motor skills will have no fun trying to click buttons or links that are clustered together. Many of the large tech companies (Apple, Google, xxx) have guidelines that stipulate the  recommended minimum dimensions of an interactive UI elements (per the WCAG). These can be summarized as:

- UI elements maintain a target hit size of at least 44px x 44px (currently, we have 48px set as a default)
  - note: this does not apply to inline links, while for rows of buttons or navigation (for example), there are guidelines for maintaining sufficient space above and below according to the above values -- even if the UI itself is not of sufficient height. See the WCAG reference below for details.
  - note: the key is the _spacing_ between adjacent UI elements. For example, the target size may be circular or square so long as it is sufficiently distanced from neigboring UI and meets minimum size criteria.

## Coginitive

This last category is usually the most difficult to define or make allowances for. In general though, we should assume that our UX, or particular aspects of it, may not be immediately understood.

For example, the function of a particular button or the consequences of a particular action may not be obvious. While the result of clicking a ðŸ“„ icon might be understood by _some_ users, consider that for others it may not be immediately obvious. Users will have different contexts and experiences from which to draw. The more context and "hints" around intent that we can provide, the better. What does a thing or action do? Will my data be safe? Did I mean to do that? Is it okay to click?

To address the example above, we should ensure that all icon buttons provide help text on hover.
