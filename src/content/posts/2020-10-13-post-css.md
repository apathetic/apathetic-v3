PostCSS is, in brief, a way to import _and scope_ your CSS. That's pretty much it. The cool/powerfule/interesting/useful ting is that it will generate a "hash" of css names and make those availalbe to your JS.  So, whatever you're doing in JS-land can directly "communicate" with or reference the CSS output that PostCSS provides.

You can use PostCSS _in tandem_ with sass if you wish. But, you may not need to.

PostCSS does not have variables. You'll find that you don't need alllll the ones that you had before in sass. For the rest, CSS vars work great.


Yes, `sass` does the import part too, but there are differences


# postCSS "vars"
  "postcss-import": "^12.0.1",


## sass-style nested syntax
"postcss-nested": "^4.2.1",
