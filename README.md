# weshatch site

This is version 3 (ish) of this site, which was bootstrapped with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). There was a [version 2](https://github.com/apathetic/apathetic-v2) -- a React App (via [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), while [version 1](https://v1.weshatch.com) is still around. Version 0 and prior exist but only live on on a hard drive somewhere...
